# 📘 What This Project Is About

This project lets you explore the world using real data from **3M+ global cities**, performing:

- 🔵 BallTree nearest-neighbor search  
- 🌐 Haversine distance calculations  
- 🧭 Direction-aware eastward pathfinding  
- 🌎 Automatic wrap-around detection at longitude 360° → 0°  
- 📊 Rich visualizations and interactive maps  
- 🧪 Data cleaning + population imputation  

It combines **data science, GIS, and graph algorithms** into a visual, easy-to-use tool.

# 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Understanding global connectivity between cities is complex:

- Cities are unevenly distributed  
- Longitudes wrap around the planet  
- Nearest city ≠ best travel path  
- Large datasets are expensive to compute  

This project solves those challenges using:

- **BallTree spatial indexing** for fast lookups  
- **Custom weighted graph building**  
- **Dijkstra-like shortest path algorithm** with eastward-only constraint  
- **Interactive visual analysis**  

It transforms a complicated computational problem into an intuitive UI.
